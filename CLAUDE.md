# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Claude GUI is a React-based desktop application providing a clean graphical interface for Claude Code. Built with modern web technologies including React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Zustand for state management, and shadcn/ui components.

## üöÄ Production Readiness Plan

### Current Status: PROTOTYPE ‚Üí TARGET: PRODUCTION-READY

ClaudeGUI has a solid foundation with OpenAI-inspired design and basic functionality, but needs significant enhancements to become production-ready. This plan outlines the path from current prototype to professional-grade development tool.

- **Build Optimization**: Production builds, PWA capabilities, CI/CD pipeline

#### Phase 2: Real Integration & Features (3-4 weeks)  
- **Claude Code CLI Integration**: Replace mock data with real CLI communication
- **MCP Server Integration**: Production-ready server management and monitoring
- **Advanced File Management**: Professional file explorer with Monaco Editor

#### Phase 3: Professional Features (2-3 weeks)
- **AI-Powered Tools**: Code analysis, smart suggestions, automated workflows
- **Analytics & Monitoring**: Performance dashboards, user tracking, cost optimization
- **Developer Experience**: Plugin system, customization, team collaboration

#### Phase 4: Production Deployment (1-2 weeks)
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Kubernetes deployment, monitoring, support system

## Development Commands

### Essential Commands
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server (port 1420)
npm run build        # TypeScript compilation + Vite production build  
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript type checking
npm run lint         # ESLint with TypeScript rules
npm run preview      # Preview production build
```

### Testing
Currently no test framework is configured. Consider adding Vitest + React Testing Library for component testing.

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **State Management**: Zustand (`src/stores/app.ts`)
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (Radix primitives + Tailwind CSS)
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming

### Project Structure
- `src/components/` - React components organized by feature
  - `ui/` - Reusable shadcn/ui components
  - `layout/` - Workspace, sidebar, header components
  - `chat/` - Chat interface components
  - `file-explorer/` - File browser functionality  
  - `terminal/` - Terminal emulator component
  - `settings/` - Settings panel
- `src/stores/` - Zustand state management
- `src/lib/` - Utility functions
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions (currently empty)

### Key Components

**Workspace Layout** (`components/layout/workspace.tsx`):
- Multi-panel configurable layout with left, right, and bottom panels
- Framer Motion animations for smooth panel transitions

## Current Limitations & Technical Debt

### Critical Issues to Address
- **Mock Data**: Currently using simulated Claude responses - needs real CLI integration
- **No Real MCP Servers**: MCP connections are simulated - needs actual server communication
- **File System**: File operations are mocked - needs real file system integration
- **No Authentication**: Missing user authentication and API key management
- **No Testing**: Zero test coverage - critical for production reliability
- **Performance**: Large bundle size (~2MB) - needs optimization
- **Security**: No input validation or security measures

### Code Quality Issues
- **Large Components**: App.tsx is 650+ lines - needs decomposition
- **State Management**: Mixed useState/Zustand usage - needs consistency
- **Type Safety**: Incomplete TypeScript coverage - needs stricter types
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling - needs comprehensive system

## Development Notes

- **CRITICAL**: Always run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` before committing changes
- **Testing**: Add tests for any new functionality (target 90%+ coverage)
- **Performance**: Monitor bundle size and optimize for production builds
- **Security**: Validate all inputs and implement proper authentication
- **Documentation**: Update this file when making architectural changes
- Follow the existing component structure and naming conventions
- Use shadcn/ui components when possible for consistency
- Leverage Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions
- Initialize both Claude Code and MCP stores on application startup
